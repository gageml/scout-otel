# To do

## Near term

- [ ] Expose models per case (currently hard coded)
- [ ] Use different API forms for different cases (context manager,
      decorator, run function)

## Roadmap

- More cases (frameworks, target transcripts)

- Generalize spec scanner to support case-defined specs (currently
  hard-codes a single spec, which happens to match what cases generate
  today)
